Our team improved reliability to 100% by optimizing load balancing with access only to the load balancer. This deepened my understanding of cloud infrastructure in resource-constrained environments. | AWS (EC2, S3, Athena, CloudWatch), Nginx, Postman, SQL |
| **[Fridge Wizard](https://fridgewizard.onrender.com/)** | Developed a full-stack app to track food expiration and suggest recipes to reduce waste. Utilized MongoDB for flexible and scalable data storage.              | JavaScript, React, Python, Django, MongoDB, Pytest, 3rd-party API |
| **[Cappybook](https://cappybook.onrender.com/)** | Built a responsive social media platform with features like posting, liking, and commenting using Go and React. Integrated PostgreSQL for data storage.          | JavaScript, React, Go, Gin, PostgreSQL             |
| **[VenBnB](https://venbnb-deployed.onrender.com/index)** | A property hire website built with Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and PostgreSQL. Users can sign up, view profiles, browse and book properties worldwide, and create listings. Developed in one week using Agile methodologies and Test-Driven Development (TDD) as part of a group project at Makers..                                                           | Python, Flask, PostgreSQL                          |
