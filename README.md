👀 I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for Python and JavaScript. Over the years, I've honed my skills to tackle complex development challenges, from integrating databases to deploying cloud services and ensuring everything is thoroughly tested.

Before transitioning into software, I spent over a decade managing restaurants, where I gained extensive experience in operations, scheduling, budget management, and team leadership. This background gives me a unique blend of technical skills and a strong operational mindset. I'm committed to continuous learning and excited to bring my mix of technical and operational expertise to innovative projects in the tech world. 👀

🌱 I'm currently upskilling in cloud engineering, focusing on AWS. I'm working on deploying apps using GitHub Actions, Terraform, and Kubernetes. I also recently completed a bootcamp at Makers Academy, focusing on Python, JavaScript, and DevOps. 🌱

💞️ I love learning and working in a team, so if you're looking to collaborate on anything from apps to Stellaris mods, send me a message! 💞️

📫 If you want to learn more, check out my CV on GitHub Pages or reach out on LinkedIn or here on GitHub. You can also send me a challenge on Codewars. 📫
